# ClassifyingElections
The 2016 election was once described as being “the most consequential presidential election in avery long time” (Aaron, 2015). The contestbetween Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton wasintense and confrontational. It captured theattention of a nation in a way that few American presidential elections have, culminating in an upset that shocked political pundits and statistical analysts alike. This paper seeks to apply data mining techniques to evaluate their effectiveness for the problem type.  In this paper, the dataset assembly process is explained in thorough detail, including the issues relating to availability and the sources of accurate demographic, economic and voting data. Customization of features in the form of feature engineering is touched upon. A brief exploration of relevant trends in the dataset is presented. The methodology, results and discussion of the application of techniques such as logistic regression, support vector classifier and boosting of decision trees is discussed to provide insight on the effectiveness of applying varying classifiers to varying subsets of the data.
